## About

Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server. It offers developers an easy way to get started, and as it uses React.js for templating, it's also a straightforward way for developers with React experience to get productive quickly.

This boilerplate makes it easier to get up and running with a well-structured Next.js and TypeScript application.
